# Simple traffic light implementations

## Version 1

In this project you will wire up and run a simple traffic light simulator.

It's based on UK style traffic lights.
 
### Components

Version 1 uses the on-board LEDs, so you can only run it on the Explorer HAT pro.

For version 2 you will need a buzzer; use the same wiring as in the earlier buzzer project

### Wiring

When you've finished, type `Ctrl-C` to exit the program.

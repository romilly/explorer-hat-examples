# Touch pads

In this simple project you will write code that uses the Explorer HAT's touch sensors.

These are projects from *Explorer Hat Tricks*, an ebook about the Pimoroni Explorer Hat Pro which you can buy on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/explorerhattricks/). That means you get a 40-day no-quibble **money back guarantee**).

No wiring is required.

The Explored HAT pro has eight touch pads, highlit in the image below.

I'll add wiring diagrams and README files to this repository as time permits.

This code has been tested using python3.

1. Install Pimoroni's Explorer Hat Library using [these instructions](https://github.com/pimoroni/explorer-hat)

## Using the examples

1. Navigate to the example or project you want to run
1. Wire up the example.
